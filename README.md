## What do I do?
I provide **training** and **technical support** for researchers on **open source tools** for **behavioral neuroscience**.

I love crafting **interactive activities** to demo tools and concepts for workshops and scientific events.

I strive to disseminate knowledge **inclusively** and **accessibly**, focusing on **new users** and **language barriers**.

### What tools?
Hardware and software for **electrophysiology** and **neuronal imaging** acquisition in freely behaving animals, as well as **behavioral recording and control**.

### Things I have been learning and teaching others about recently:

- [Harp](https://harp-tech.org/)
- [UCLA Miniscopes](http://miniscope.org/)
- [Bonsai](https://bonsai-rx.org/)
- [DeepLabCut](https://deeplabcut.github.io/DeepLabCut/README.html)

### Why that username tho?
Well... back in Intro to CS for Biologists I did that "learn what version control is and create your first repository" lesson. I didn't know it would stick with me forever. I was Chuckles on many sites and here I was ChucklesOnGitHub (probably because Chuckles was taken). Testimony to the fact that you can do cool stuff without knowing everything... just get started! The constant reminder is humbling.

<!--
**ChucklesOnGitHub/ChucklesOnGitHub** is a âœ¨ _special_ âœ¨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.
